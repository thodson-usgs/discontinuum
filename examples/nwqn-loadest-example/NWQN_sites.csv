#SITE_ABB: A text abbreviation of the site name primarily for use within the National Water Quality Program
#SITE_QW_ID: Unique USGS station number indicating location where water-quality samples are collected (Note that opening this file in Excel may cause leading zeros to be dropped from this field unless imported into an open worksheet and changing columns A and B to text)
#SITE_QW_NAME: Unique USGS station name indicating where water-quality samples are collected.
#DA: Drainage area upstream from the water-quality sampling location in square miles. Drainage area is displayed as NA for Mississippi and Atchafalaya River sites downstream from the Old River diversion.
#QW_LAT: Latitude where water-quality samples are collected
#QW_LONG: Longitude where water-quality samples are collected.
#SITE_FLOW_ID: Typically a unique USGS station number indicating location where streamflow data is recorded. In some instances these data are obtained from outside sources--in those cases the site number used by that entity is displayed. If no site number is available an abbreviated indicator of the collecting agency is displayed  (Note that opening this file in Excel may cause leading zeros to be dropped from this field unless imported into an open worksheet and changing columns A and B to text) 
#SITE_FLOW_NAME: Unique USGS station name indicating where streamflow associated with water-quality samples are collected. In some instances these data are obtained from outside sources--in those cases the site name used by that entity is displayed
#FLOW_LAT: Latitude of site where streamflow data associated with the water-quality sampling was located.
#FLOW_LONG: Longitude of site where streamflow data associated with the water-quality sampling was located.
#SITE_TYPE: Character representation of the type of monitoring site
