    "Let's select some sites that have a nice variety of rating curves. We will include ones with clear breaks and shifts and others without breaks and minimal shifts. Site number 12413470 is a good example of a rating with a clear break around a stage of 2.7m and very recent and drastic shift. 10131000 is another good example of a rating with a break, but no real shifts in time. 09261000 is a site with no breaks and minimal shifts making it an ideal basic example. Finally, 10154200 also has no prominent breaks, but it does have a very clear shifting with time. Therefore, these four sites should be a nice standard for testing `rating-gp`."

    "One major advantage of `rating-gp` is that the resulting model can be used to make predictions of a rating curve at any moment in time. To see how well our model can predict rating curve across time, let's plot the rating curves for each site at an interval of every 5 years at the start of a water year (i.e., October 1st). This way we can see how well the model accounts for any shift in the rating with time. As this will be several plots, let's save each collection of plots for a given date to a page in a pdf for easy checking."
