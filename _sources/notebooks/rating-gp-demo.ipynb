We will include ones with clear breaks and shifts and others without breaks and minimal shifts. USGS site number 12413470 is a good example of a rating with a clear break around a stage of 2.7m and very recent and drastic shift. 10131000 is another good example of a rating with a break, but no real shifts in time. 09261000 is a site with no breaks and minimal shifts making it an ideal basic example. Finally, we will keep 10154200 as it has no prominent breaks, but it does have a very clear shifting with time. Therefore, these four sites should be a nice standard for testing how `rating-gp` performs on different rating curves."
